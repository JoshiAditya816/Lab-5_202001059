# Lab-5_202001059
Here I have used Mypy tool to do Static Analysis of a buggy file in a repsoitory on github.
## Error in code
```
from snippets import (
    lambda_array,
    read_file,
    calculate_unpaid_loans,
    calculate_paid_loans,
    average_paid_loans,
    foo
)
```

## Understanding of the error
When we import a module, mypy may report that it is unable to follow the import. This can cause errors that look like
the given above in snapshot.

If we get any of these errors on an import, mypy will assume the type of that module is snippets, the dynamic type. 

This can result in mypy failing to warn us about errors in our code. Since operations on any result in snippets, these
dynamic types can propagate through our code, making type checking less effective.
